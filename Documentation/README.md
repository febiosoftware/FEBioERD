# FEBio Elastic Reaction Diffusion (ERD) solver plugin
This repository contains a solver plugin for FEBio. This plugin simplifies the multiphasic framework by removing explicit modeling of permeability, electrokinetics, and changes in effective chemical concentration due to deformation.
This repository was motivated by kinematic growth theory where tissue growth occurs on much longer time spans than elastic mechanics associated with the removed physics.

This repository also contains examples input files of kinematic growth driven by chemical species evolution.. 

The instructions to reproduce the problems in FEBio are available here:
